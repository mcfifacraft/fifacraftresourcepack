## Information

<br>
</div>

- This resource pack contains all of the texture and models that make up the game.

- OptiFine is highly recommended so you are able to see the custom CEM model for the football, but it is not necessary; you can play the game perfectly fine without it. 
  - Optionally, you could use any mod that adds CEM functionality to the game.
